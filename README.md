## Welcome

Create a release based workflow that is built on the foundations of the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). When your team uses a release-based workflow, GitHub makes it easy to collaborate with deployable iterations of your project that you can package and make available for a wider audience to download and use.

GitHub releases allow your team to package and provide software to your users based on a specific point in the history of your project.

- **Who is this for**: Developers, DevOps Engineers, IT Operations, managers, and teams.
- **What you'll learn**: How to follow a release-based workflow.
- **What you'll build**: You will create tags, releases, and release notes.
- **Prerequisites**: If you need to learn about branches, commits, and pull requests, take [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github) first.
- **How long**: This course takes less than 1 hour to complete.

In this course, you will:

1. Create a beta release
2. Add a feature to a release
3. Open a release pull request
4. Add release notes and merge
5. Finalize a release
6. Commit a hotfix
7. Create a hotfix release

1. Right-click **Start course** and open the link in a new tab.
2. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.
3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the new repository's README.
